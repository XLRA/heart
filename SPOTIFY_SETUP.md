# Spotify Integration Setup

This music player now supports Spotify integration! Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Create a Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - App name: "Heart Music Player" (or any name you prefer)
   - App description: "A beautiful music player with Spotify integration"
   - Website: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/callback`
5. Click "Save"

## 2. Get Your Credentials

1. In your app dashboard, click on your app
2. Copy the "Client ID"
3. Note the "Client Secret" (you won't need it for this implementation)

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

Replace `your_client_id_here` with your actual Client ID from step 2.

## 4. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the Spotify Web API:

```bash
npm install
```

## 5. Start the Application

```bash

```
