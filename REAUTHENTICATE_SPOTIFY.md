# Re-authenticate Spotify for Audio Analysis

The heart animation now supports real Spotify audio analysis, but you need to re-authenticate with additional permissions.

## Why Re-authentication is Needed

The audio analysis feature requires additional Spotify API permissions that weren't included in your original authentication. The 403 Forbidden errors you're seeing are because the current access token doesn't have the required scopes.

## How to Fix This

1. **Log out of Spotify** in the app (click the logout button in the top-right)

2. **Log back in** by clicking "Connect Spotify" again

3. **Grant the new permissions** when prompted by Spotify

## What's New

- **Real Audio Analysis**: When available, the heart will react to actual beat timing, frequency data, and loudness from Spotify's analysis
- **Enhanced Simulation**: When audio analysis isn't available, the heart uses improved simulation based on track position and time
- **Better Visual Feedback**: 
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green dot = Real audio analysis active
  - ðŸŸ  Orange dot = Enhanced simulation mode
  - ðŸ”´ Red dot = Loading audio analysis
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple dot = Local audio file mode

## Expected Behavior

After re-authentication:
- The heart should beat more dramatically and accurately with the music
- You'll see "Spotify Visualizer (Real Audio Analysis)" in the tooltip
- The 403 errors should disappear from the console

## If Audio Analysis Still Fails

Some tracks may not have audio analysis data available from Spotify. In this case, the app will automatically fall back to enhanced simulation mode, which still provides a great visual experience.

Enjoy your enhanced heart animation! ðŸŽµðŸ’–
